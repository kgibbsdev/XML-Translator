# XML-Translator

1.) Place the "_XML-Translator" folder into the same directory as the XML files you would like to add to a .csv file. 

2.) Double-click "_Run XML-Translator" shortcut to begin the transfer process.

3.) A console window will open. Press '1' to read all XML files in the same directory as the "_XML Translator" folder into a .csv file. This will generate a "CSVs" folder with two subfolders. "To Be Translated" and "Translated". The former will have the generated CSV with the date/time it was created.

4.) When you have a CSV that is ready to be read back into XML files, simply place the CSV into the "Translated" folder, run the application via the "_Run XML-Translator" shortcut. The content within the CSV file will be read back into the existing XML files in the same directory as the "_XML Translator" folder.

5.) Place the XML files back into the proper directory.

NOTES: 
 - It's recommended that you COPY all files into the directory with the "_XML-Translator" folder.

 - The translator will ignore all files that are not .xml or .csv format, so their inclusion/exclusion will not matter in any directory.
